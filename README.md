# ParcelSure
A decentralized and transparent way to insure your parcels through blockchain using web3 technologies

## Our Goal
To provide a platform where consumers can get their parcel insured in a transparent and decentralised manner. They don't need to trust a seller 
or a shippping company. They can choose any insurance policy that they like. We offer daily payouts for package delays. 

## Target Audience 
Our inspiration for this was the dropshipping industry which has been expanding thanks to how easy it is to create online stores on Shopify. However, a
key problem is shipping times, customers are hesitatnt weather their orderes would arrive on time or at all. Reputed brands would offer compensation on
cancellations. 
However, no one offers payouts on delays, we want to give SME the same level of trust that centralised companies such as Amazon have. Even though
they might not be able to deliver as promptly as Amazon, consumers do have the garuntee that they would be componsated for delays.

## Tools we have used 
- Chainlink
- Solidity
- IPFS
- Hardhat 
- Svelte 
- Polygon

### Testing Dependancy
- In order to locally test our parcel [trackingAPI](https://github.com/sanatcodes/mockAPItestingMore/tree/improving_api) we mocked it using [Varcel](varcel.com)
